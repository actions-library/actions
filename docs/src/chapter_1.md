# Chapter 1: What are actions?

Some data-structures describe the state of an application. Those structures should not be freely modifiable. 

Instead, they should be provided `Action`s.

**An action is a piece of data that describes how the state of the program should change.**

An action can be *applied* to a datastructure.
